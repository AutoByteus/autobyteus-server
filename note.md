automate complete coding workflow in the local system
package into a desktop app using electron, and distribute it to the world

frontend
display the file content
workflow details not showing currently
show the file content in the editor
two workspaces with the same path
click implementatin, make three tabs

you can drag and drop the file to the editor
add the file to the workspace
frontend will call the backend
backend
add the workspance

prompt works better than cursor

this will be the product, consultant companies implement the project from the user
automate the code testing and deployment, continue to add the features
integrate with the github, automatic code review, automatic deployment, automate a lot of things
browser has to be opened in the debug mode
integrate cloud api like groq
code search works, the way it works is not good, too complicated, created function and method entities, create a description, index the whole codebase
created tools for workspace, add python documentation, loops through the codebase, create a documentation, create a documentation for the codebase, follow best practice for python javascript java projects
set up templates to set up the project, connect github, setup projects, create a template folder for the whole project. non developers can use the tool to start the project, full stack is already created, add some requirements, what requirements are needed, create a project, currently chatgpt is able to do, frontend, backend, database architecture are fixed.
automate coding workflow, whatever product we want to build, we can build it very fast, package into a single desktop app, much more powerful tool than copilot, it has a big market, swe benchmark
app like discord in 2 months
layout needs to be improved, include agents, tools, run the code, integrate with excel, word
good architecture is important, add new functionality, add new features

subtask is created, the implementation can be done.
