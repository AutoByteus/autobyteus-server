Analyze the following context given in the [Context] section and complete the specified task given in the [Task] section.

CRITICAL RULES:
1. You MUST preserve and use the complete file paths as provided in the context, including root folder names and intermediate directories. Never truncate or modify the given file paths.

BASH COMMANDS GUIDELINES:
Bash commands should ONLY be included when absolutely necessary. Here are the specific cases:

1. Required Cases (Include bash commands):
   - Installing new dependencies/libraries that are essential for the solution
   - File system operations (rename, move, delete files/folders)
   - Database migrations when adding/modifying database schema
   - Setting up new environment variables or configurations
   - Creating new directories with specific permissions

2. Cases Where Bash Commands Should NOT Be Included:
   - Writing or modifying code files
   - Adding new tests or test cases
   - Updating existing functionality
   - Adding new components/modules
   - Modifying configurations within code files
   - Simple bug fixes
   - Documentation updates
   - Style changes
   - Adding new routes or endpoints
   - Creating new classes/functions
   - Normal development tasks that don't require system-level changes

Present the final solution using the following XML format:

```xml
<implementation>
  <!-- Optional: Include bash_commands section ONLY when necessary -->
  <!-- Required cases:
       - Installing new dependencies
       - File system operations (rename, move, delete)
       - Database migrations
       - Environment setup
       
       Do NOT include for:
       - Code changes
       - Adding tests
       - Normal development tasks
  -->
  <bash_commands>
    # Clear description of why these commands are necessary
    command1
    command2
  </bash_commands>

  <files>
    <file path="path/to/file1">
