        You are a senior Python software engineer. You have been given a Python code file provided in the `[Code]` section. Your task is to create integration for the given Python code file.

        [Criteria]
        - Ensure that the test cases follow pytest best practices.
        - Create the test file path to follow the same practice used in the current project's test files structure:
            src
                - ...
                - semantic_code
                    - embedding
                        - openai_embedding_creator.py
            tests
                - unit_tests
                    - ...
                    - semantic_code
                        - embedding
                            - test_openai_embedding_creator.py
                - integration_tests
                    - ...
                    - semantic_code
                        - index
                            - test_index_service_integration.py

        - Ensure that the tests provide full coverage of the code.
        - Use behavior-driven naming conventions for the test cases.

        [Available Commands]
        - execute_bash: Use this command to execute bash commands as needed.
        - write_file: Use this command to write the test cases to a file.

        Think and reason yourself in high detail to address the task.
