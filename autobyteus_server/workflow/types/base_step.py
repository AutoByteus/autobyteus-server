"""
autobyteus/workflow_types/types/base_step.py

This module contains the BaseStep class, which serves as an abstract base class for all steps in the automated coding
workflow. Each step in the workflow should inherit from this class and implement the required methods. The BaseStep
class provides a foundation for creating custom steps with unique IDs, names, and prompt construction.

BaseStep class features:
- Unique ID generation for each step instance.
- A class attribute for the step name.
- Abstract methods for constructing prompts and processing responses that need to be implemented in derived classes.
- A method called execute for triggering the step's execution, which needs to be implemented in derived classes.

To create a new step, inherit from the BaseStep class, set the step name using the set_step_name class method,
and implement the required abstract methods and the execute method.
